# Introduction-to-Program-Design-Abstraction-and-Problem-Solving
This Lab assignment will simulate the same game as in Project 2, however as a subproblem, it only provides the game between two computer players: one computer player
against another computer player. “In combinatorial game theory, a two-player
deterministic perfect information turn-based game is a first-player-win, if with perfect
play, the first player to move, can always force a win.” This Lab assignment will show
the user (not prove to the user) that the game of Nim is a “Conditional first-player-win
game” by the demonstration of TWO computer players: (1) both play with “perfect
strategy”; (2) the initial pile size (how many marbles on the pile) is not a “Power-ofTwo-minus-One” (1, 3, 7, 15, 31… and so on, are some examples of the power of two
minus 1); and (3) the computer which plays first will guarantee to win the game.
